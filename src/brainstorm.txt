Ideas To Be Discussed:

1) Attack Timing and Nondamaging Frames
	- Attacks deal from x to y damage depending upon when in their animation they connect
	- Attack animations will have frames at the beginning and end that do not cause damage
	- Landing an attack between the first damaging frame and the final damaging frame applies damage linearly from min to max damage
	- *UNSURE* Connecting on the final frame of an attack will trigger "Perfect Timing" the player will be notified and the attack will do bonus damage?

2) Poise System
